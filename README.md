THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password

WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

```

### The Process

I created a random password generator by adding scripts to the json file. For this assignment, I used: 

* Prompts that allow users to determine their preferred password length (on the condition that it is between 8 and 128 characters)

* Confirms that determine what types of characters user would like to use (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters).

* A function that would generate a password based on the information returned from these prompts and confirms.
